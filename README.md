# Probability and Applied Statistics Project 2

This repository contains the second project for the Probability and Applied Statistics course. The project is divided into several parts, each focusing on different statistical analyses and applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following parts:

- **Part1**: Generates Graphs using three different ways: Using no libraries, using MATLAB, and using JFREEChart with Apache math commons respectively. There is also a report for each PSS.
- **Part2**: Includes the csvs, graphs, python scripts, and a report that uses the csvs and histograms generated to create questions for each section covered.
- **Part3**: Includes a screenshot of hello world, and a report on my attempt to port the Pokemon game to Android app.
- **Supplemental Parts**: Includes Stats Library and a tester class, as well as the formula sheet. 

## Features

- **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**: Each part delves into specific statistical methods and their applications.
- **Practical Implementations**: Real-world data sets are used to demonstrate the concepts discussed.
- **Supplemental Parts**: Additional Parts Not defined as Part 1,2 or 3.
